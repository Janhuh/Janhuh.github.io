    <h1>Welcome to the Second Page</h1>
    <p>I couldn't come up with something to say here, so I'm going to show you my dog Kira! Here she is:</p>

    <h2>My Dog's Life Progress 🐾</h2>
<p>My collie is 5.5 years old. Collies usually live up to around 15 years.</p>
<progress value="5.5" max="15"></progress>

<p>That's about 37% of her estimated lifespan. ❤️</p>
