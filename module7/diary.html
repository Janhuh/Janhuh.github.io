        <h3> Day 87 of the Spawning Off-Season</h3>
    

      <h4>Dear diary,</h4>
      This morning started as usual: hiding behind the reeds, 
      glaring at the roaches (the fish, not the bugs), and ignoring 
      the carp who always talk too loudly. 
      <br>Honestly, I don’t know how they’re not eaten faster. 
      Subtlety is an art, and I, being a true 
      European perch, am the Picasso of shadows.
      <br> <br>
      Had a minor territorial dispute with a young pike. 
      <br>I told him, 
      “You’re not that long yet, buddy.” He didn’t like that. I didn’t care.
       He flared his fins like he was hot stuff, but I swam a tight circle around 
       him and disappeared into the murk. Classic perch move. Felt pretty good about that one.

       <h3> Day 89 of the Spawning Off-Season</h3>
      <h4>Dear diary,</h4>
      A group of tourists dropped something shiny from the dock again.
       Humans are fascinating. Always throwing things into the water, 
       never retrieving them. Today’s gift was a small, silver keychain. 
       <br> <br>
       I guarded it for most of the afternoon until a nosy bream tried to nibble it. 
       I chased him halfway across the cove. Victory was mine. 
       <br>The keychain now rests in my secret collection next to a green plastic ring and a Barbie shoe. 
       One day I will build a shrine. For what purpose, I’m not yet sure. 
       But it will be glorious.

       <h3> Day 93 of the Spawning Off-Season</h3>
      <h4>Dear diary,</h4>
      I had an existential moment today. 
      <br>
      While drifting near the surface, I caught a glimpse of myself reflected in the bottom of a human boat. 
      My stripes looked especially sharp in the sunlight. 
      Do they make me look aggressive? Too aggressive? I've been told I’m “the angry one” of the lake. 
      I prefer “passionately expressive.”
      <br> <br>
      Later, I got stuck in some discarded fishing line. Embarrassing. 
      Thankfully, my dorsal fin is as sharp as my wit. I freed myself in minutes.
       No one saw… except a smug tench who winked at me. Rude.
       <br> Maybe I'll have him for dinner tomorrow.
      <br> <br>

       <h3> Day 100 of the Spawning Off-Season</h3>
       <h4>Dear diary,</h4>
      At dusk, the minnows were schooling again. 
      They always move in that hypnotic swirl like they're dancing to music only they can hear. 
      I watched from the shadows, just for the beauty of it. Didn’t even lunge once. 
      Maybe I’m getting soft. Or maybe I’ve just had enough minnow for one week.
      <br> <br>
      Final thoughts for today:
      The lake is colder now. Winter is stirring beneath the surface. 
      I can feel it in my scales. Fewer bugs, slower snails, and the pike are getting hungrier. 
      I’ll need to be even sharper in the coming days. 
      <br>But for now, I’m safe, my shrine is growing, 
      and the silver keychain sparkles just right under moonlight.
      
      <br> <br>Until tomorrow,
      <br>
