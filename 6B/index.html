            <h3>About CATS</h3>
            <p>One of the best things about cats is that they are generally very independent creatures. Some more than others.
                <br><br>
                Unlike dogs, who require quite a high level of attention each day, 
                cats are quite happy to have time to themselves. 
                In fact, cats will sleep for about 15 hours a day so 
                you don't have to worry about them being too bored when you're at work. 
                <br><br>
                But when you do decide to activate them, cats can be a very versatile pet! 
                Cats can learn tricks and go on walks. They can even do agility (jumping over obsticales) or do circus acts!
